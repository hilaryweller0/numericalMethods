    "# Review of Strassmann, Reinert and Dipankar\n",

    "### Notes from the Associate Editor\n",
    "The reviewer raises questions about the order of convergence of your implementation of PPM. I seem to spend a long time looking at why schemes are not converging with the expected order so I thought I would look into this with my own implementation of PPM. This raises an important point. The work presented in the manuscript is not reproducible. Not enough details were given so that I could be sure that I was reproducing the same test case for the constant, uniform velocity test in section 4.1, figure 2. Please double check the entire manuscript and ensure that enough detail is given so that an expert reader can reproduce all of your results, like I have tried to do. I have made some guesses below about how you implemented the convergence with resolution test.\n",
    "\n",
    "My implementation, below, differs from yours in these ways:\n",
    "1. I am using periodic boundary conditions. I suspected that this may help with the convergence.\n",
    "2. I am sampling the initial conditions at grid points rather than the higher-order initialisation that you implemented. I think that this shouldn't harm the convergence because the analytic solution is sampled in the same way and the initial conditions are smooth.\n",
    "3. I also tried using a sine wave as initial conditions as it is infinitely continuous with periodic boundary conditions.\n",
    "4. I tried using a fixed Courant number of all simulations as well as a fixed time step, which I think was your approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise my results, I am getting convergence around 3, similar to you."
